Hello.
This is my battleship game.

Used technologies python3,mongodb,numpy,pymongo,pygame

The ai in this game is an algorithm which saves all possible locations of the ship coordinates
,when a ship is hit, in the database.
It then chooses one of the points and if one of the enemy ships was hit it continues to select from that pool.
When not it deletes that pool.
